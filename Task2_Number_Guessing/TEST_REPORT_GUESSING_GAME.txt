================================================================================
                          DETAILED TEST ANALYSIS
================================================================================

FUNCTIONALITY COVERAGE:

✅ INPUT VALIDATION
   - Accepts valid integers in range 1-100
   - Rejects negative numbers
   - Rejects numbers outside 1-100 range
   - Rejects non-numeric inputs
   - Rejects floating point numbers
   - Handles empty strings and whitespace
   - Handles special characters and mixed alphanumeric

✅ GUESS COMPARISON LOGIC
   - Correctly identifies "too low" guesses
   - Correctly identifies "too high" guesses
   - Correctly identifies correct guesses
   - Works at minimum boundary (1)
   - Works at maximum boundary (100)
   - Handles off-by-one scenarios
   - Handles large differences between guess and secret

✅ WIN CONDITION CHECKING
   - Detects correct guess (win)
   - Detects incorrect guess (lose)
   - Works at all values in range 1-100
   - Properly distinguishes between win/lose by exact match only

✅ GAME FLOW INTEGRATION
   - Input validation works before comparison
   - Comparison logic leads to correct win detection
   - Invalid inputs don't affect game state
   - Multiple operations work consecutively


CRITICAL FUNCTIONALITY TESTS:

1. Boundary Value Testing
   Input: '1', '100', '0', '101'
   Expected: First two valid, last two invalid
   Actual: ✅ PASS - Boundaries enforced correctly

2. Range Validation
   Input: '-5', '0', '1-100 range', '101', '999'
   Expected: Only 1-100 accepted
   Actual: ✅ PASS - Range validation works perfectly

3. Comparison Accuracy
   Input: (25, 50), (75, 50), (50, 50)
   Expected: 'too_low', 'too_high', 'correct'
   Actual: ✅ PASS - All comparisons accurate

4. Win Detection
   Input: Multiple scenarios with correct and incorrect guesses
   Expected: Win only when guess == secret
   Actual: ✅ PASS - Win detection 100% accurate

5. Input Error Recovery
   Input: Mix of invalid inputs followed by valid input
   Expected: Invalid inputs rejected, valid input accepted
   Actual: ✅ PASS - System recovers properly from errors


GAME SCENARIO TESTING:

Scenario 1: Lucky First Guess
├─ Input: 50 (when secret is 50)
├─ Process: Validate → Compare → Check Win
└─ Result: ✅ PASS - Win on first try

Scenario 2: Multiple Guesses
├─ Guesses: 25 (low), 75 (high), 40 (low), 60 (high), 50 (correct)
├─ Process: Validate each → Compare each → Win on 5th guess
└─ Result: ✅ PASS - Correct win after multiple attempts

Scenario 3: Binary Search Pattern
├─ Guesses: 50 (high), 25 (low), 37 (correct)
├─ Process: Standard binary search strategy
└─ Result: ✅ PASS - Efficient game play works

Scenario 4: Error Handling
├─ Invalid inputs: 'abc', '-5', '101', '', '50.5'
├─ Followed by: Valid input '50'
├─ Process: Reject all invalid, accept valid
└─ Result: ✅ PASS - Robust error recovery
